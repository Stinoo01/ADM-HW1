Here you will be able to find the files for the **ADM-HW1**. 
In this repository, you will be able to find the code for Problem 1 and Problem 2 as well as the pdf file with the Hackerrank submissions and the grades of Problem 3 (AWS Modules).

File [Problem1](https://github.com/Stinoo01/ADM-HW1/blob/main/Problem1.py) contains the python script for the hackerrank exercises for the Problem 1. 

File [Problem2](https://github.com/Stinoo01/ADM-HW1/blob/main/Problem2.py) contains the python script for the hackerrank exercises for the Problem 2.

_Note: in the file submissions, you will find exercises for Problem 1 and 2 but you will find also additional exercises that I solved during my Bachelor's Degree ([Bioinformatics](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/it/corso/2023/30422/home)) during other homeworks. In the file Problem1 you will find the code for all the exercises but if you wish to find also the code for the other exercises, you will be able to find them in this repository._
