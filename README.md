# ADM-HW1 - Stefano Rinaldi

Here you will be able to find the files for the **ADM-HW1**. 
In this repository, you will be able to find the code for Problem 1 and Problem 2 as well as the pdf file with the Hackerrank submissions and the grades of Problem 3 (AWS Modules).

File [Problem1](https://github.com/Stinoo01/ADM-HW1/blob/main/Problem1.py) contains the python script for the hackerrank exercises for the Problem 1. 

File [Problem2](https://github.com/Stinoo01/ADM-HW1/blob/main/Problem2.py) contains the python script for the hackerrank exercises for the Problem 2.

File [Problem3](https://github.com/Stinoo01/ADM-HW1/blob/main/problem3.pdf) contains the grades for the AWS modules.

File [submissions](https://github.com/Stinoo01/ADM-HW1/blob/main/submissions.pdf) contains the hackerrank submissions for both Problem 1 and 2.

_Note: in the file submissions, you will find exercises for Problem 1 and 2 but you will find also additional exercises that I solved during my Bachelor's Degree ( [Bioinformatics](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/it/corso/2023/30422/home) ) during the exam [Principles of Computer Sicences II](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/it/view-course-details/2023/30422/20190322090929/0a714116-48d2-43d9-bf01-8cb596dfa201/dd9fbf0b-56fe-44cd-9065-b7585bb17a52/939d6e3f-855b-4387-a235-3beb917ab9c3/68fc648e-f40e-4431-9972-1db5bef8c3f7?guid_cv=dd9fbf0b-56fe-44cd-9065-b7585bb17a52&current_erogata=0a714116-48d2-43d9-bf01-8cb596dfa201). Therefore, in the file [Problem1](https://github.com/Stinoo01/ADM-HW1/blob/main/Problem1.py) you will find the code for all the exercises required for this homework but in submissions you will find additional exercises. If you wish to look at the code for these additional exercises, you will be able to find their code in [this repository]()._
